### Churn prediction problem
Losing customers is costly for any business. Identifying unhappy customers early gives you a chance to offer them incentives to stay. You will use ML to automate the identification of unhappy customers, also known as customer churn prediction.
ML models rarely give perfect predictions, so you will learn how to adjust for prediction mistakes in your total ML costs.
The example of churn that may be familiar to you; leaving a mobile phone service provider for a competitor. If a provider is aware that a particular customer is considering leaving, it can offer timely incentives, perhaps in the form of a phone upgrade, to encourage the customer to continue service.
Incentives are often more cost-effective than losing and reacquiring a customer.

### Dataset
Mobile phone service providers keep historical records on customers who churn bit ultimately continue using the service. You can use this data to construct an ML model of one mobile phone provider’s churn using a process called training.
You’ll train the model, can pass the profile information of an arbitrary customer to the model, and have the model predict whether this customer is going to churn. The model will make mistakes—predicting the future is tricky. However, you will learn how to manage prediction errors.
The dataset used is publicly available and is mentioned in the book Discovering Knowledge in Data by Daniel T. Larose. The author attributed the dataset to the University of California Irvine Repository of Machine Learning Datasets.
